.SYNOPSIS
    Milan Hardware Integration Test - Build and Run
    
.DESCRIPTION
    Builds and runs the Milan hardware integration test that can be deployed
    to different machines for real hardware testing with Intel NICs.
    
.PARAMETER Clean
    Clean build directory before building
    
.PARAMETER ConfigOnly
    Only configure CMake, don't build
    
.PARAMETER TestOnly
    Only run the test, don't build
    
.EXAMPLE
    .\test_milan_hardware_on_different_machine.ps1
    
.EXAMPLE
    .\test_milan_hardware_on_different_machine.ps1 -Clean
