# üõ†Ô∏è Repository Rules and Best Practices

These rules define coding standards, collaboration protocols, and repository hygiene for working in this project. They apply to all files and folders (`applyTo: '**'`).

---

## ‚úÖ General Principles

* **Real-World Testing**
  Never mark a feature or fix as *"ready"*, *"done"*, or *"complete"* until it has passed all relevant tests, including **real hardware testing** if applicable.

* **Maintain `Todo.md`**

  * When a task is completed, **remove it from `Todo.md`**.
  * Log completed tasks in `docs/completed/`.
  * Newly discovered tasks or requirements must be added to `Todo.md`.

* **Manage Documentation Lifecycle**

  * **Consolidate** duplicate or redundant task descriptions.
  * **Move completed** task descriptions to `docs/completed/`.
  * **Archive outdated** or irrelevant content to `docs/archive/`.

---

## üåø Branch and Commit Conventions

* **Branch Naming**
  Use clear, conventional prefixes:

  ```
  feature/*    for new features  
  bugfix/*     for bug fixes  
  hotfix/*     for critical patches  
  refactor/*   for code restructuring  
  doc/*        for documentation-only changes
  ```

* **Commit Message Format**
  Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

  ```
  feat: Add login form validation  
  fix: Correct rounding error in tax calculator  
  chore: Update npm dependencies  
  docs: Rewrite usage section of README  
  refactor: Simplify caching logic
  ```

---

## üîç Code Quality and Reviews

* **Code Reviews**
  All non-trivial changes must undergo **peer review** before merging into the main branch.

* **Static Analysis and Linting**
  Code must pass **all linters and static analysis checks** before being committed or merged.

* **Mark Experimental Work**
  Clearly prefix experimental features or unstable prototypes with `EXPERIMENTAL:` in:

  * Commit messages
  * Documentation
  * Code comments, where applicable

---

## üìö Documentation

* **Design Decision Logs**
  Use `docs/decisions/` to document key architecture or design decisions. Use the [ADR pattern](https://adr.github.io/) for consistency.

* **Technical Debt and Refactoring**

  * Mark areas needing cleanup in code using `TODO (refactor)`
  * Schedule regular refactoring sessions to resolve tech debt items from `Todo.md`

* **Completed Taskss**
  Use `docs/completed/` to log completed tasks, features, or fixes. Include:

  * Date of completion
  * Description of work done
  * Any relevant links or references
* **Archive Outdated Content**
  Move outdated or irrelevant documentation to `docs/archive/` to keep the main docs clean and focused.

* **Work In Progress (WIP) Documentation**
  Use `docs/work-in-progress/` for ongoing work that is not yet ready for review or merging. Include:

  * Clear status updates
  * Next steps or blockers
  * Links to related issues or discussions

* **Implementation Plans**
if we come up with implementation Plans we should init a new file in `docs/work-in-progress/` folder
  Use `docs/work-in-progress/` for detailed implementation plans. Include:

  * Background and context
  * Problem statement
  * Proposed solution
  * Risks and open questions
  * Next steps or milestones

  which should keep maintained while work is in progress.

## üß† Concept and Design Proposal Rules

When proposing a new **concept**, **feature**, or **architecture**:

- **Respect Existing Design Decisions**  
- Review `docs/decisions/` and `docs/completed/` before starting any concept.  
- Avoid contradicting past decisions unless you explicitly justify and document the changes.

- **Create Structured Concept Documents**  
- Use the `docs/concepts/` folder.  
- Naming convention:  
  ```
  docs/concepts/YYYY-MM-DD_short-title.md
  ```
- Each file should include the following sections:
  - **Background** ‚Äì context and motivation  
  - **Problem Statement** ‚Äì what needs solving  
  - **Prior Decisions** ‚Äì list of related ADRs or completed items  
  - **Proposed Solution** ‚Äì clear, focused proposal  
  - **Alternatives Considered**  
  - **Risks and Open Questions**  
  - **Next Steps** ‚Äì implementation or review plan

- **Ensure Real Abstractions**  
Abstraction layers must:
- Be **generic and reusable**  
- **Hide implementation details** cleanly  
- Be **extensible** without breaking existing interfaces  
- **Avoid tight coupling** between layers or modules  
- Document **extension mechanisms** (e.g., callbacks, interfaces, hooks)

- **Discuss Before You Build**  
- Submit a concept as a pull request or internal review before beginning implementation.  
- Encourage feedback and iteration early in the process.
- Do not rely on assumptions. Always verify behavior, inputs, and results through tests, logs, documentation, or direct inspection. If something is unclear, investigate until you are certain.

‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid Assumptions ‚Äì Verify Everything
Do not rely on assumptions. Always verify behavior, inputs, outputs, and side effects through testing, logs, or direct inspection. If something is unclear ‚Äî investigate until it‚Äôs confirmed.

Document Lessons Learned
------------------------

To avoid repeating mistakes and to enable optimized workflows, all important discoveries and debugging insights must be documented.

Use the 'docs/insights/' Folder:
- Store each lesson learned or technical insight as a separate file in docs/insights/.

Purpose:
- Prevent recurring mistakes and inefficient trial-and-error
- Capture non-obvious behavior or system quirks
- Enable better decision-making and onboarding
- Serve as a long-term reference for debugging or optimizing

File Naming Convention:
- docs/insights/YYYY-MM-DD_short-title.md

Each Insight File Should Contain:
- Context        ‚Äì What problem was being worked on
- Observation    ‚Äì What was discovered or unexpected
- Root Cause     ‚Äì (if identified)
- Resolution     ‚Äì What fixed or improved the situation
- Takeaways      ‚Äì Key points to remember or apply in the future

Guideline:
- If something took more than 15 minutes to figure out and might happen again ‚Äî write it down.
