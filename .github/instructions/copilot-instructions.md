# üõ†Ô∏è Repository Rules and Best Practices

These rules define coding standards, collaboration protocols, and repository hygiene for working in this project. They apply to all files and folders (`applyTo: '**'`).

---

## ‚úÖ General Principles

* **Real-World Testing**
  Never mark a feature or fix as *"ready"*, *"done"*, or *"complete"* until it has passed all relevant tests, including **real hardware testing** if applicable.

* **Maintain `Todo.md`**

  * When a task is completed, **remove it from `Todo.md`**.
  * Log completed tasks in `docs/completed/`.
  * Newly discovered tasks or requirements must be added to `Todo.md`.

* **Manage Documentation Lifecycle**

  * **Consolidate** duplicate or redundant task descriptions.
  * **Move completed** task descriptions to `docs/completed/`.
  * **Archive outdated** or irrelevant content to `docs/archive/`.

---

## üåø Branch and Commit Conventions

* **Branch Naming**
  Use clear, conventional prefixes:

  ```
  feature/*    for new features  
  bugfix/*     for bug fixes  
  hotfix/*     for critical patches  
  refactor/*   for code restructuring  
  doc/*        for documentation-only changes
  ```

* **Commit Message Format**
  Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

  ```
  feat: Add login form validation  
  fix: Correct rounding error in tax calculator  
  chore: Update npm dependencies  
  docs: Rewrite usage section of README  
  refactor: Simplify caching logic
  ```

---

## üîç Code Quality and Reviews

* **Code Reviews**
  All non-trivial changes must undergo **peer review** before merging into the main branch.

* **Static Analysis and Linting**
  Code must pass **all linters and static analysis checks** before being committed or merged.

* **Mark Experimental Work**
  Clearly prefix experimental features or unstable prototypes with `EXPERIMENTAL:` in:

  * Commit messages
  * Documentation
  * Code comments, where applicable

---

## üìö Documentation

* **Design Decision Logs**
  Use `docs/decisions/` to document key architecture or design decisions. Use the [ADR pattern](https://adr.github.io/) for consistency.

* **Technical Debt and Refactoring**

  * Mark areas needing cleanup in code using `TODO (refactor)`
  * Schedule regular refactoring sessions to resolve tech debt items from `Todo.md`

---
üß† Concept and Design Proposal Rules
When proposing a new concept, feature, or architecture:

Respect Existing Design Decisions

Review docs/decisions/ and docs/completed/ before starting any concept.

Avoid contradicting past decisions unless you explicitly justify and review them.

Create Structured Concept Documents

Use the docs/concepts/ folder.

Naming convention:

bash
Kopieren
Bearbeiten
docs/concepts/YYYY-MM-DD_short-title.md
Each file should include:

Background ‚Äì context and motivation

Problem Statement ‚Äì what needs solving

Prior Decisions ‚Äì list of related ADRs or completed items

Proposed Solution ‚Äì clear, focused proposal

Alternatives Considered

Risks and Open Questions

Next Steps ‚Äì implementation or review plan

Ensure Real Abstractions

Abstraction layers must:

Be generic and reusable

Hide implementation details cleanly

Be extensible without breaking existing interfaces

Avoid tight coupling between layers or modules

Document extension mechanisms (e.g. callbacks, interfaces, hooks)

Discuss Before You Build

Submit a concept as a pull request or for review before starting implementation.

Encourage feedback and iteration before committing to a path..
