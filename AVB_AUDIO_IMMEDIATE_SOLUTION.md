# ============================================================================

## The Problem:

### 1. Install Virtual Audio Cable:
```
Download: https://vb-audio.com/Cable/
- Installs "CABLE Input" and "CABLE Output" in Windows
- Appears as real audio device in Windows

```

### 2. Audio Routing Script:
```powershell
# Create AVB-to-Windows Audio Bridge
.\create_avb_audio_bridge.ps1
