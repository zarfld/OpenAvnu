# OpenAvnu DAW02 Testing Package
# Quick deployment and execution guide

## Files to Transfer to DAW02

### Core Testing Scripts
1. `run_daw02_tests.sh` - Master test runner (orchestrates all tests)
2. `test_01_build_verification.sh` - Build verification test
3. `test_02_intel_hal_detection.sh` - Intel HAL integration test
4. `DAW02_TESTING_PLAN.md` - Comprehensive testing documentation

### Quick Start on DAW02

#### Linux/WSL Systems:
```bash
# 1. Make scripts executable
chmod +x *.sh

# 2. Run complete test suite
./run_daw02_tests.sh

# 3. Or run individual tests
./test_01_build_verification.sh
./test_02_intel_hal_detection.sh
```

#### Windows Systems:
```powershell
# 1. Run in Git Bash or WSL
bash run_daw02_tests.sh

# 2. Or use PowerShell equivalent (if needed)
```

## What the Tests Do

### 🧪 **Master Test Runner** (`run_daw02_tests.sh`)
- Collects system information
- Runs all tests in sequence
- Generates comprehensive report
- Creates archive for analysis

### 📋 **Build Verification** (`test_01_build_verification.sh`)
- Tests clean build from scratch
- Verifies all 3 daemons compile:
  - MRPD (MRP/STP Protocol)
  - MAAP (MAC Address Allocation)
  - Windows/Linux Shaper (Traffic Shaping)
- Measures build performance
- Tests basic executable functionality

### 🔧 **Intel HAL Detection** (`test_02_intel_hal_detection.sh`)
- Tests build WITHOUT Intel HAL (software fallback)
- Tests build WITH Intel HAL (if available)
- Detects Intel network hardware
- Verifies graceful fallback behavior
- Confirms hardware independence

## Expected Outputs

### ✅ **Success Case**
```
🧪 OpenAvnu DAW02 Testing Suite Starting...
📋 Running: 01_BuildVerification
   ✅ PASSED
📋 Running: 02_IntelHALDetection  
   ✅ PASSED

🎉 All tests passed! OpenAvnu is ready for production on DAW02.

📋 Master Report: test_results_*/OpenAvnu_DAW02_Master_Report.md
```

### ⚠️ **Failure Case**
```
📋 Running: 01_BuildVerification
   ❌ FAILED

⚠️ 1 test(s) failed. Review the master report for details.
```

## Generated Reports

### 📊 **Master Report**
- `OpenAvnu_DAW02_Master_Report.md` - Complete test summary
- System information
- All test results
- Failure analysis
- Recommendations

### 📁 **Detailed Logs**
- Individual test logs with full output
- System information file
- Build artifacts and error details

## Analysis Framework

### Cross-Platform Comparison
Compare results between:
- Development machine (Windows with Visual Studio)
- DAW02 (target deployment system)
- Any differences in build behavior
- Performance characteristics

### Hardware Independence Verification
- ✅ Builds without Intel hardware
- ✅ Builds without Intel HAL libraries  
- ✅ Graceful fallback to software implementations
- ✅ Consistent functionality across systems

### Deployment Readiness Assessment
- Build system compatibility
- Runtime dependency satisfaction
- Network interface detection
- Performance baseline establishment

## Next Steps After Testing

### 1. Review Results
```bash
# View master report
cat test_results_*/OpenAvnu_DAW02_Master_Report.md

# Archive results
tar -czf daw02_test_results.tar.gz test_results_*
```

### 2. Transfer Results Back
```bash
# Copy to shared location or transfer back to dev machine
scp daw02_test_results.tar.gz user@devmachine:/path/to/analysis/
```

### 3. Analysis and Next Steps
- Compare with development machine results
- Identify any platform-specific issues
- Plan production deployment strategy
- Document deployment requirements

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Build Failures
- **Missing CMake:** Install CMake 3.16+
- **Missing Compiler:** Install GCC/Clang or Visual Studio
- **Missing PCAP:** Install libpcap-dev (Linux) or Npcap (Windows)

#### Permission Issues
- **Network Tests:** May require root/admin for network interface access
- **Runtime Tests:** Some tests may fail without proper network setup

#### Intel HAL Issues  
- **HAL Build Failures:** Expected if Intel HAL libraries not installed
- **Hardware Detection:** Expected to show "not found" on non-Intel systems

## Contact and Support

If tests reveal issues:
1. Review detailed logs in `test_results_*/`
2. Check the comprehensive testing plan in `DAW02_TESTING_PLAN.md`
3. Archive and send results for analysis
