## Current Status

- ‚úÖ **Implementation Phase**: Complete (compiled, mock tested)
- üîÑ **Real Hardware Testing Phase**: Required before marking as complete
- ‚ùå **Production Ready**: NO - pending hardware validation

## Hardware Testing Requirements

### Required Hardware Environment

1. **AVB/TSN Network Interface Cards**
   - Intel I210/I211/I225 series (preferred)
   - Other AVB-capable network interfaces
   - Minimum 2 devices for talker/listener testing

2. **Network Infrastructure**
   - AVB/TSN capable switch OR
   - Direct connection between test devices
   - Proper network timing configuration

3. **Test Environment**
   - Linux environment with OpenAvnu daemon support

#### 3. Multi-Profile Integration Tests
- [ ] Simultaneous Milan + Automotive streams
- [ ] Profile switching without network disruption
- [ ] Cross-profile compatibility validation
- [ ] Resource allocation with multiple profiles

#### 4. Performance and Compliance Tests
- [ ] Real-world latency measurements
- [ ] Network bandwidth utilization
- [ ] CPU/memory overhead with real streams
- [ ] IEEE 1722 compliance validation
- [ ] Interoperability with third-party AVB devices

### Test Environment Setup

#### Hardware Configuration
```bash
# Example test setup
Device A (Talker): Intel I225 + Milan Profile
Device B (Listener): Intel I210 + Automotive Profile  
Network: AVB switch OR direct connection
```

#### Software Requirements
```bash
# Required packages
- OpenAvnu daemons (gptp, mrpd, maap_daemon)
- ALSA/PulseAudio for audio testing
- GStreamer for video testing
- Network analysis tools
```

#### Test Execution Framework
```bash
# Integration test structure

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ avtp_pipeline_profile_milan_hardware_test.sh
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ avtp_pipeline_profile_automotive_hardware_test.sh

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ multi_profile_integration_test.sh

```

### Success Criteria

The implementation can only be marked as **COMPLETE** when:

1. ‚úÖ All basic integration tests pass with real hardware
2. ‚úÖ All profile-specific tests demonstrate compliance
3. ‚úÖ Multi-profile scenarios work reliably
4. ‚úÖ Performance meets or exceeds profile requirements
5. ‚úÖ No regressions in existing OpenAvnu functionality
6. ‚úÖ Third-party device interoperability confirmed

### Risk Assessment

#### High Risk Items
- **Hardware Availability**: May require specific AVB-capable hardware
- **Network Setup Complexity**: AVB network configuration can be challenging
- **Timing Sensitivity**: Real-world timing may differ from simulation
- **Driver Dependencies**: Hardware-specific driver requirements

#### Mitigation Strategies
- **Hardware Procurement**: Identify and obtain required test hardware
- **Environment Documentation**: Create detailed setup instructions
- **Incremental Testing**: Start with basic tests, build complexity
- **Fallback Plans**: Virtual testing environments for initial validation

### Testing Timeline

#### Phase 1: Hardware Setup (Estimated: 1-2 days)
- Acquire and configure test hardware
- Set up OpenAvnu environment
- Validate basic AVB functionality

#### Phase 2: Basic Integration (Estimated: 2-3 days)
- Test profile factory with real hardware
- Validate configuration parsing
- Confirm daemon integration

#### Phase 3: Profile Validation (Estimated: 3-5 days)
- Test each profile type thoroughly
- Measure real-world performance
- Validate compliance requirements

#### Phase 4: Production Readiness (Estimated: 1-2 days)
- Multi-profile testing
- Stress testing
- Documentation finalization

**Total Estimated Timeline: 7-12 days**

## Next Actions Required

1. **Immediate**: Update project status to reflect hardware testing requirement
2. **Short-term**: Acquire necessary hardware and set up test environment
3. **Medium-term**: Execute comprehensive hardware testing plan
4. **Long-term**: Only mark as complete after successful hardware validation

## Documentation Updates Required

- [ ] Move current status from "COMPLETE" to "IMPLEMENTATION READY"
- [ ] Add hardware testing requirements to main documentation
- [ ] Create detailed test procedures in `docs/tests/`
- [ ] Update `Todo.md` with hardware testing tasks

**Status**: Implementation ready, pending real hardware validation as required by repository rules.
