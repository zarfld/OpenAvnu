# Documentation Cleanup and Organization

This script organizes the OpenAvnu documentation into a clear structure.

## Files to Archive (Redundant/Outdated)

The following files contain redundant or outdated information and should be archived:

- `thirdparty/gptp/FINAL_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` - Covered by organized docs
- `thirdparty/gptp/FINAL_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Covered by organized docs
- `thirdparty/gptp/GPTP_PROFILE_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Covered by organized docs
- `thirdparty/gptp/MILAN_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` - Covered by organized docs
- `thirdparty/gptp/MILAN_PROFILE_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Covered by organized docs

## Files to Keep in Place (Component-Specific)

These files are specific to particular components and should remain in their current locations:

- `thirdparty/gptp/ANNOUNCE_INTERVAL_SIGNALING_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Specific feature
- `thirdparty/gptp/ENHANCED_SOFTWARE_TIMESTAMPING_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Specific feature
- `thirdparty/gptp/MILAN_BASELINE_INTEROPERABILITY_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Specific feature

## New Documentation Structure

### docs/status/
- `CLOCK_QUALITY_TESTING_STATUS.md` - âœ… Created - Current status of clock quality testing
- `GPTP_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` - ðŸ“‹ To be created - Overall gPTP implementation status
- `AVTP_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` - ðŸ“‹ To be created - AVTP pipeline status

### docs/completed/
- `CLOCK_QUALITY_TESTING_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - âœ… Moved - Complete clock quality implementation
- `GPTP_CORE_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - ðŸ“‹ To be created - Core gPTP implementation summary
- `AVTP_PIPELINE_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - ðŸ“‹ To be created - AVTP pipeline implementation

### docs/work-in-progress/
- `CLOCK_QUALITY_ADVANCED_FEATURES.md` - âœ… Created - Advanced clock quality features
- `GPTP_FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md` - ðŸ“‹ To be created - Future gPTP enhancements
