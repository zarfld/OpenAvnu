   - Milan profile loading verification
   - Clock quality parameter validation
   - asCapable compliance logic testing

2. **Performance Measurement**
   - 30-second continuous monitoring
   - Process stability analysis
   - CPU and memory usage tracking
   - Hardware timestamping verification

3. **Network Synchronization Testing**
   - 60-second peer discovery monitoring
   - PDelay exchange counting
   - BMCA event detection
   - Synchronization achievement verification

### Hardware Requirements Met

- **Intel Adapters Supported**: I210, I219, I225, I226
- **Hardware Timestamping**: Active and validated
- **Network Connectivity**: Gigabit Ethernet with proper IP configuration
- **Administrator Privileges**: Recommended for full timestamping capabilities

### Milan Specification Compliance

- **Milan 5.6.2.4**: asCapable compliance implementation verified
- **Clock Quality**: Enhanced clock quality parameters applied

- **Profile Management**: Milan-specific configuration loading

## User Instructions

### Step 1: Verify Network Setup
```powershell
cd "c:\Users\dzarf\source\repos\OpenAvnu-2"
.\verify_milan_network_setup_simple.ps1
```

### Step 2: Run Milan Compliance Testing
```powershell
cd "c:\Users\dzarf\source\repos\OpenAvnu-2\thirdparty\gptp"
.\test_milan_compliance_validation.ps1
```

### Step 3: Interpret Results

**Configuration Compliance**: Must show "SUCCESS VERIFIED"
**Protocol Behavior**: Must show "SUCCESS VERIFIED"  
**Performance Readiness**: Should show "SUCCESS READY FOR NETWORK TESTING"

**Network Testing Results**:
- **Peer Discovery**: SUCCESS indicates Milan devices detected
- **PDelay Exchanges**: Count of successful timing exchanges
- **Synchronization**: ACHIEVED indicates network-wide clock sync

## Network Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: No Milan Peers (Current Status)
```
[MILAN NETWORK COMPLIANCE] PENDING: No active Milan peers detected
* Ensure Milan-compatible devices are powered on
* Check network connectivity and VLAN configuration
```

**Next Steps**: Connect Milan-compatible devices and re-run test

### Scenario 2: Milan Peers Detected
```
[NETWORK TEST] PEER DISCOVERY: Milan peer device(s) discovered!
[NETWORK TEST] PDelay success count: 5
[MILAN NETWORK COMPLIANCE] SUCCESS: Full Milan network synchronization verified!
```

**Outcome**: Ready for audio streaming applications

### Scenario 3: Partial Synchronization
```
[MILAN NETWORK COMPLIANCE] PARTIAL: Network communication established
* Peers detected but full synchronization pending
* May require longer convergence time
```

**Action**: Monitor for extended period or check network configuration
