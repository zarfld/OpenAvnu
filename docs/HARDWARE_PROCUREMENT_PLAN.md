- Complete hardware research
- Finalize procurement plan
- Submit purchase requests

### Week 2 (July 15-22, 2025)
- Begin hardware procurement
- Set up test environment infrastructure
- Prepare testing procedures

### Week 3 (July 22-29, 2025)
- Receive and install hardware
- Begin basic functionality testing
- Document initial results

### Week 4 (July 29-August 5, 2025)
