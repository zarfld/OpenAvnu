**Duration**: 2 weeks (July 12-26, 2025)

## 📋 **TARGET TEAMS & STAKEHOLDERS**

### **1. gPTP Development Team**
**Focus**: Time synchronization precision and performance requirements

**Key Questions**:
- Q1: Does Phase 1 HAL provide sufficient MAC address and link status accuracy for gPTP sync?
- Q2: What timestamping precision is required for your target IEEE 1588 performance class?
- Q3: Would <1μs HAL call latency vs ~5-10μs impact gPTP synchronization quality?
- Q4: Do you need direct access to Intel adapter hardware timestamps?

**Phase 1 Performance**: ✅ 0.162μs average latency, real MAC/link status
**Phase 2 Potential**: 🚀 5-10x timestamping precision, hardware register access

### **2. AVTP Pipeline Team**
**Focus**: Device enumeration, network state awareness, streaming performance

**Key Questions**:
- Q1: Does Phase 1 device enumeration meet your adapter detection requirements?
- Q2: Do you need real-time network interface state monitoring?
- Q3: Would hardware register access improve AVTP streaming performance?
- Q4: Is Phase 1 Windows API integration sufficient for production deployment?

**Phase 1 Performance**: ✅ Real hardware data, 100% Windows API integration
**Phase 2 Potential**: 🚀 Direct hardware access, enhanced real-time monitoring

### **3. Testing & Validation Team**
**Focus**: Test framework capabilities, regression testing, validation accuracy

**Key Questions**:
- Q1: Do Phase 1 improvements enable meaningful regression testing vs hardcoded values?
- Q2: Would Phase 2 hardware register access improve test coverage?
- Q3: What are your testing infrastructure requirements (CI/CD, automation)?
- Q4: Do you need performance benchmarking capabilities for different HAL backends?

**Phase 1 Performance**: ✅ Real validation data, meaningful test results
**Phase 2 Potential**: 🚀 Hardware-level validation, advanced benchmarking

**Contact**: [Testing Team Lead]  
**Status**: ⏳ Awaiting feedback

### **4. Production Deployment Team**
**Focus**: Real-world usage, deployment complexity, maintenance requirements

**Key Questions**:
- Q1: Are you satisfied with Phase 1 Windows API integration for production use?
- Q2: How important is sub-microsecond HAL performance for your use cases?
- Q3: What are your concerns about Phase 2 intel_avb backend integration complexity?
- Q4: Do you have specific hardware requirements that need direct register access?

**Phase 1 Performance**: ✅ Production-ready, Windows API reliability
**Phase 2 Potential**: ⚠️ Increased complexity, enhanced hardware access

**Contact**: [Production Team Lead]  
**Status**: ⏳ Awaiting feedback

## 📊 **FEEDBACK COLLECTION METHODOLOGY**

### **Structured Interview Format**
**Duration**: 30-45 minutes per team  
**Format**: Video call with technical demonstration

**Agenda**:
1. **Phase 1 Demo** (10 min): Show current HAL performance and capabilities
2. **Requirements Analysis** (15 min): Discuss team-specific needs and pain points
3. **Phase 2 Evaluation** (15 min): Present backend integration benefits and trade-offs
4. **Decision Input** (5 min): Collect Go/No-Go recommendation and rationale

### **Feedback Scoring Matrix**
Each team scores criteria on 1-5 scale:

| Criteria | Weight | Current Phase 1 Satisfaction | Phase 2 Need Level |
|----------|--------|------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Functionality** | 30% | ⏳ TBD | ⏳ TBD |
| **Performance** | 25% | ⏳ TBD | ⏳ TBD |
| **Reliability** | 20% | ⏳ TBD | ⏳ TBD |
| **Maintainability** | 15% | ⏳ TBD | ⏳ TBD |
| **Deployment Ease** | 10% | ⏳ TBD | ⏳ TBD |

**Scoring Guide**:
- 5: Excellent/Critical Need
- 4: Good/High Need  
- 3: Adequate/Moderate Need
- 2: Poor/Low Need
- 1: Unacceptable/No Need

## 🎯 **SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR PHASE 2 APPROVAL**

### **Quantitative Thresholds**
- **User Satisfaction**: >80% teams rate Phase 1 as adequate (3+) BUT identify clear Phase 2 benefits
- **Performance Requirements**: >2 teams need sub-microsecond latency or hardware register access
- **Complexity Acceptance**: >75% teams willing to accept Phase 2 integration complexity
- **ROI Justification**: Clear technical/business case for 3-6 month development investment

### **Qualitative Indicators**
- Clear use cases where Phase 2 provides significant value over Phase 1
- Team commitment to testing and validating Phase 2 implementation
- Identified production scenarios that require backend integration capabilities
- Alignment with long-term architectural goals
