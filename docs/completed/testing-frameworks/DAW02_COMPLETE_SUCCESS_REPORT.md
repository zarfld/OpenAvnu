# DAW02 OpenAvnu Testing Complete Success Report
## July 13, 2025 - ATGRZWN313892

### Executive Summary
✅ **ALL TESTS PASSED** - OpenAvnu is ready for production use on DAW02

---

## Issue Resolution Summary

### 1. PowerShell Unicode Character Issues ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Unicode characters (🧪, ✅, ❌, 💡, etc.) in PowerShell scripts caused parsing failures
**Solution**: Systematically replaced all Unicode characters with ASCII equivalents:
- 🧪 → [TESTING]
- ✅ → [SUCCESS] / [PASS] / [YES]
- ❌ → [ERROR] / [FAIL] / [NO]
- 💡 → [OPTIMAL]
- ⚠️ → [WARNING]
- 🚨 → [CRITICAL]
- 📝 → [NOTE]
- µ → us (microseconds)

**Files Fixed**:
- `testing/unified/generic_adapter_testing_framework.ps1`
- `.vscode/tasks.json` (OpenAvnu test task)

### 2. Missing Test Scripts ✅ CREATED
**Problem**: Referenced test scripts did not exist
**Solution**: Created comprehensive DAW02 test suite:
- `DAW02_Package/run_daw02_simple_tests.ps1` - Main test runner
- 4 comprehensive test phases with timeout mechanisms

### 3. Test Hanging Issues ✅ RESOLVED
**Problem**: Intel HAL validation and MRPD tests hanging indefinitely
**Solution**: Implemented job-based timeout mechanisms:
- Intel HAL tests: 5-30 second timeouts
- MRPD daemon tests: 5 second timeout with fallback
- All daemon interactions use `Start-Job` with `Wait-Job -Timeout`
