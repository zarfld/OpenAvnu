## Testing Requirements

All new features and bug fixes must include unit tests with at least 80% coverage.
Integration tests must cover all critical workflows and interactions between components.
Test results must be stored in `docs/tests/results/` with date and time of test runs.

## Testing Environment

Before running tests, ensure the environment is set up correctly:
- Use `docs/machine/` for machine-specific information
- Respect machine capabilities and limitations  
- Document any specific configurations or dependencies required for testing
