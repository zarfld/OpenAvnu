# Intel HAL Test Integration in CI/CD Workflows

## Overview

The Intel HAL hardware validation test has been integrated into the OpenAvnu CI/CD workflows to provide automated hardware testing capabilities across different development and test machines.

## GitHub Actions Integration

### Workflow: Manual Test on DAW02

**File**: `.github/workflows/Manual_Test_DAW02_clean.yml`

The Intel HAL validation test is now included as a dedicated step in the manual test workflow:

```yaml
- name: Intel HAL Hardware Validation Test
  if: ${{ github.event.inputs.run_intel_hal_test == 'true' }}
  shell: pwsh
  run: |
    # Runs tests/hardware/intel_hal_validation_test.exe
    # Captures output and saves results to docs/tests/results/
    # Provides detailed logging and exit code validation
```

### Workflow Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `run_intel_hal_test` | `true` | Enable/disable Intel HAL hardware validation |
| `test_phase` | `all` | Test phases to run (includes HAL test in all phases) |
| `adapter_filter` | (empty) | Filter tests to specific Intel adapter types |
| `verbose_output` | `true` | Enable detailed output for debugging |

### Test Execution Flow

1. **Build Phase**: Intel HAL validation test is built as part of the Release build
2. **Intel HAL Test**: Dedicated step runs hardware validation
3. **Result Collection**: Test results are saved to `docs/tests/results/intel_hal_validation_{run_id}.log`
4. **Artifact Archival**: Results are uploaded as workflow artifacts for 30 days

## Test Results Format

The Intel HAL test generates structured results:

Test Output:
=== Intel HAL Integration Validation Test ===
✅ Test 1: Intel HAL Initialization - PASSED
✅ Test 2: Device Enumeration - PASSED (Found 1 Intel devices)
✅ Test 3: Device Opening - PASSED (Intel I219-LM, ID: 0x0DC7)
✅ Test 4: Hardware Capabilities - PASSED (IEEE 1588 + Native OS Integration)
✅ Test 5: Timestamp Reading - PASSED (Hardware timestamps functional)
✅ Test 6: Device Cleanup - PASSED
=== All Tests Passed (6/6) ===
```

## Manual Execution

### Local Testing

You can run the Intel HAL validation test locally:

```bash
# Build the project first
cmake --build build --config Release

# Run the Intel HAL validation test
cd build/tests/hardware/Release
./intel_hal_validation_test.exe
```

### Via GitHub Actions

1. Navigate to the **Actions** tab in the GitHub repository
2. Select **"Manual Test on DAW02"** workflow
3. Click **"Run workflow"**
4. Configure parameters:
   - ✅ **run_intel_hal_test**: `true`
   - **test_phase**: `all` or specific phase
   - **adapter_filter**: Leave empty or specify (e.g., `I219`)
   - **verbose_output**: `true` for detailed logging
5. Click **"Run workflow"** to start

## Test Coverage

The Intel HAL validation test covers:

| Test Area | Coverage | Hardware Requirement |
|-----------|----------|---------------------|
| **HAL Initialization** | Intel HAL library loading and setup | Any Intel adapter |
| **Device Enumeration** | Detection of Intel I210/I219/I225/I226 | Intel adapter present |
| **Device Opening** | Hardware access and communication | Intel adapter accessible |
| **Capability Detection** | IEEE 1588, MDIO, Native OS features | Intel adapter with PTP |
| **Timestamp Reading** | Hardware timestamp functionality | Intel adapter with working PTP |
| **Resource Cleanup** | Proper HAL shutdown and cleanup | Any Intel adapter |

## Integration Benefits

### For Development
- **Automated Validation**: Every build includes hardware verification
- **Regression Detection**: Hardware functionality changes detected immediately
- **Cross-Machine Testing**: Validates hardware across different test systems
- **Documentation**: Automated result logging for troubleshooting

### For Deployment
- **Hardware Compatibility**: Verifies Intel adapter support before deployment
- **Baseline Establishment**: Creates hardware capability baselines
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensures hardware timestamping functionality
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Regular validation of hardware functionality

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Test Not Found**
   ```
   ❌ Intel HAL validation test not found at: build/tests/hardware/Release/intel_hal_validation_test.exe
   ```
   **Solution**: Ensure the project built successfully with `OPENAVNU_BUILD_INTEL_HAL=ON`

2. **No Intel Devices Found**
   ```
   ❌ Test 2: Device Enumeration - FAILED (No Intel devices found)
   ```
   **Solution**: Verify Intel I210/I219/I225/I226 adapter is present and drivers installed

3. **Device Access Failed**
   ```
   ❌ Test 3: Device Opening - FAILED (Access denied)
   ```
   **Solution**: Run workflow with administrator privileges or check adapter permissions

### Debug Information

Enable verbose output in the workflow to get detailed debug information:
- Set `verbose_output: true` in workflow parameters
- Check `docs/tests/results/intel_hal_validation_{run_id}.log` for detailed logs
- Review GitHub Actions workflow logs for step-by-step execution details

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
- [ ] **Multi-Adapter Testing**: Validate multiple Intel adapters simultaneously
- [ ] **Performance Benchmarking**: Add timestamp precision measurements
- [ ] **Cross-Platform Support**: Extend to Linux runners with Intel adapters
- [ ] **Advanced Features**: Test I225/I226 enhanced capabilities (TSN, etc.)

### Integration Opportunities
- [ ] **Pull Request Validation**: Add Intel HAL test to PR checks
- [ ] **Nightly Testing**: Schedule regular hardware validation runs
- [ ] **Release Validation**: Include in release qualification workflows
- [ ] **Performance Regression**: Track hardware performance over time
