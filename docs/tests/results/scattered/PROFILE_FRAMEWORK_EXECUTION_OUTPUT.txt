   ✓ Stream 1 activated with profile MILAN

🔍 Demonstrating Profile Compatibility...
   • MILAN 1.1 -> MILAN 1.0: ✅ Compatible (backward)
     - Security overlap: Both support AES-128-GCM
     - Timing overlap: Both use 250μs tolerance
   • MILAN -> AVB: ❌ Incompatible (security mismatch)
     - MILAN requires authentication, AVB has none
   • Automotive -> MILAN: ✅ Compatible (negotiated)
     - Common cipher: AES-256-GCM
     - Timing ranges overlap

📊 Simulating Quality Metrics...
   Initial metrics:
     Packets sent: 1000
     Packets lost: 2
     Jitter: 0.1 ms
   ✅ Jitter 0.1ms within MILAN tolerance (0.25ms)

   Degraded network conditions:
     Jitter: 2.0 ms
   ⚠️  Jitter 2.0ms exceeds MILAN tolerance (0.25ms)
   🔄 Attempting automatic adaptation...
     - Searching for compatible profile with higher tolerance
     - Found MILAN Interop variant (1ms tolerance)
