# CI Build Issues - Final Analysis and Solution

## Problem Summary
- Local configuration works perfectly in 13 seconds with all features
- CI environment consistently fails after 34+ seconds in configuration phase
- Multiple optimization attempts have not resolved the core CI issue

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue is definitely CI environment-specific since:
1. ✅ Local CMake 4.0.3 + VS 2022 Community works perfectly
2. ❌ CI CMake 3.31.6 + VS 2022 Enterprise fails consistently
3. ✅ All submodules are properly initialized (29s step succeeds)
4. ✅ PCAP SDK downloads and installs correctly (5s step succeeds)

## Final Solution Strategy
Since we cannot access CI logs to see the specific error, we need a robust approach:

1. **Bypass LA_AVDECC temporarily** - Most likely source of CI issues
2. **Use minimal reliable configuration** - Focus on core OpenAvnu functionality
3. **Add progressive feature enabling** - Build up from working base
4. **Comprehensive error capture** - Get detailed logs for analysis

## Implementation Plan
1. Start with absolutely minimal CMake configuration
2. Add features one by one to identify what breaks
3. Provide multiple fallback configurations
4. Ensure we get SOME working build for further debugging

This approach will finally give us a working CI build and identify exactly which component is causing the CI failures.
